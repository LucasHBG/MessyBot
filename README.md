# MessyBot
He's exactly like his name suggests

# About
This bot was created only for Discord servers. It was really cool challenge for us.
Discord's library was helpfull and there's some servers that can help you out in most of your problems.
Overall it took some months to create our main tool and then I (Lucas) did the !spam command for our friend's servers.

# Halloween event
For Halloween events I created this command !role to add a role with some ghosts prefix and suffix of the role's name.

## To install required packages from package.json
